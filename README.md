# spatial-RL
Generative models and learning algorithms for spatial decision problems.

ToDo:

- Ask Nick about settings for networks
    * Lattice
        * Dimensions for 100, 500, 1000?
    * BA
        * Initial network size
        * Probability of random uniform connection
    * Nearest neighbors
        * What even is this     
- Figure out why lattice SIS isn't giving same scores reported in draft
    * Confirm how scores were calculated
- Figure out why Ebola tranmission probs are so low
    * What units does Nick use for pop?
    * Which parameters were used for the Ebola model? (lots are commented out)
